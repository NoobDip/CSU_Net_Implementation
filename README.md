# CSUNet: Convolutional-Swin U-Net for Image Segmentation

CSUNet is a convolutional-transformer hybrid architecture designed for image segmentation tasks. It combines the efficiency of convolutional operations with the expressive power of transformers using the Swin Transformer modules.

## Features

- **Hybrid Architecture:** Integrates convolutional layers (DConv) with Swin Transformer blocks for feature extraction and spatial attention.
- **Patch Operations:** Utilizes patch merging and expansion techniques to handle large-scale features efficiently.
- **Upsampling and Decoding:** Includes Swin Transformer blocks in the decoding path for feature refinement and spatial context aggregation.
- **Final Convolutional Layer:** Concludes with a convolutional layer for segmentation output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- torchvision
- einops
- timm

## Usage

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Training:**

   - Prepare your dataset and adjust configurations in the script.
   - Train the model using the provided training pipeline.

3. **Evaluation:**

   - Evaluate the trained model on test datasets.
   - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and Dice coefficient.

4. **Inference:**

   - Use the trained model for inference on new images.
   - Visualize segmentation outputs and refine as necessary.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to use CSUNet for segmentation:

```python
# Initialize and load the model
model = CSUNet()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('csunet.pth'))

# Perform inference on a sample image
input_image = Image.open('sample_image.jpg')
preprocessed_image = preprocess(input_image)
output = model(preprocessed_image)

# Post-process and visualize the segmentation mask
segmentation_mask = postprocess(output)
visualize(input_image, segmentation_mask)
```
